# MOOD DAPP

## This is my first DApp!

You are welcome! Thanks for joining me on my journey into blockchain
development. This is the first DApp that I built using the following
tools:

> 1. Solidity: to write the smart contract
>
> 2. HTML & CSS: for the frontend web interface\
>    ...and a pinch of Javascript to connect the smart contract to the frontend interface.

This simple DApp takes your input `MOOD` and stores it in the Ropsten blockchain network.

You type in your current mood and click on the `SET MOOD` button to trigger the setMood() in the smart contract.\
To retrieve your saved or SET mood, you click on the `GET MOOD` button. You have to be patient and allow the network to confirm the transaction first before you click on the GET MOOD button.

I believe you have seen my other beginner's work. I am eager to learn and build functional products using blockchain. And of course, do not expect any perfection from me at this point. This is my first DApp. A little step in my journey, but a giant leap in my earnestness. I truly look forward to becoming better and more knowledgeable - an expert in both smart contracts and their integration into our day-to-day life.
